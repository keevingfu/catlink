        <h2>Insights & Recommendations</h2>
        <p>This sunburst chart visualizes common phrases using prepositions related to cat litter boxes.  This provides insight into user needs and search intent.  Here's a breakdown by preposition:</p>

        <div class="preposition-category">For (Purpose/Suitability)</div>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Specialized Needs:</strong>  "For" phrases indicate a search for litter boxes suited to specific needs:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Litter Type:**  "cat litter box for pine pellets" suggests a demand for boxes compatible with non-clumping, larger-particle litters.  These boxes often need larger sifting holes or different designs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Multiple Cats:** "cat litter box for multiple cats" highlights the need for larger boxes, multiple boxes, or boxes designed to handle higher waste volume.</li>
                    <li><strong>Space Constraints:**  "cat litter box for small spaces" points to a demand for compact, corner-fitting, or otherwise space-saving designs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cat Size:** "cat litter box for large cats" and "cat litter box for Maine Coon" show a need for extra-large boxes that provide ample room for bigger breeds.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
             <li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Offer a variety of litter box sizes and styles, clearly labeling them with their suitability for different litter types, cat sizes, and household situations. Provide detailed dimensions.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="preposition-category">Near (Proximity/Location)</div>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Purchase Intent & Placement Concerns:** "Near" is used in two distinct contexts:
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Finding Retailers:** "cat litter box near me," "cat litter box near me open now," and "cat litter box for sale near me" are clear indicators of purchase intent.  Users are looking for nearby stores that sell litter boxes.</li>
                <li><strong>Placement Within the Home:</strong> "cat litter box near food" and "cat litter box near furnace" express concerns (or perhaps existing, undesirable situations) about where *not* to put the litter box.  These highlight common anxieties about hygiene and safety.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Recommendations:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>For Retailers:**  Use location-based services and SEO to ensure your store appears in "near me" searches.  Clearly display store hours.</li>
                    <li><strong>For Informational Sites/Blogs:**  Provide clear guidance on proper litter box placement, emphasizing separation from food/water and avoiding heat sources.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

      <div class="preposition-category">To (Proximity/Location)</div>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Purchase Intent & Placement Concerns:** The phrases provided with the preposition "to" duplicate those provided for "near."
            </li>
            <li><strong>Recommendations:</strong> Follow the same recommendations provided for "near."
            </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="preposition-category">With (Features/Accessories)</div>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Desired Features:**  "With" phrases focus on specific features:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Lid/Cover:** "cat litter box with lid" and "cat litter box with cover" show a strong preference for enclosed boxes, likely for odor control, privacy, and reducing litter scatter.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sifting Mechanism:**  "cat litter box with sifter" indicates a desire for easier cleaning and less scooping.</li>
                    <li><strong>High Sides:** "cat litter box with high sides" suggests a need to prevent litter from being kicked out, common with cats that dig enthusiastically.</li>
                    <li><strong>Door:** "cat litter box with door" implies a desire for maximum enclosure, potentially for odor control or aesthetics.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
              <li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Offer a range of litter boxes with these features, highlighting their benefits in product descriptions.  Consider offering "add-on" lids or sifters for existing boxes.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="preposition-category">Without (Absence/Alternatives)</div>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Unconventional Approaches & Concerns:** "Without" phrases reveal less common, but still important, considerations:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Litter Alternatives:**  "cat litter box without litter" and "cat litter box without sand" suggest a search for alternative litter materials (perhaps due to allergies, cost, or environmental concerns) or alternative toileting systems for cats. "cat box without litter" is a slight variation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Open Boxes:** "cat litter box without lid" indicates a preference for open-top boxes, possibly due to cat preference, easier cleaning, or better ventilation.</li>
                   <li><strong>No Litter Box at All?:</strong> "can you have a cat without a litter box" is a fundamental question about cat ownership and toileting.  While possible in some situations (e.g., outdoor cats), it generally requires significant training and alternative solutions.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Recommendations:</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>Address the "no litter box" question directly, providing information on alternatives (outdoor access, specialized training, etc.) and their pros and cons.</li>
                  <li>Offer information about alternative litter materials (paper, wood pellets, etc.) and their suitability.</li>
                  <li>Clearly differentiate between covered and uncovered litter box options.</li>
                </ul>

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Overall Recommendation:</strong> This analysis reveals diverse needs and preferences among cat owners.  Providing a wide range of litter box options, clear product information, and helpful guidance on placement and alternatives will cater to this broad audience.</p>
